# Feature Specification: SMS scanning, category prediction, income & dashboard

**Feature Branch**: `001-sms-scanning-to`
**Created**: 2025-09-25
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "SMS scanning to automatically capture debit and credit transactions from bank messages; category prediction with manual override; income tracking including recurring monthly inflows; manual expense entry; dashboard showing current month expenses with charts, category breakdown and trends; daily end-of-day sync to a Google Drive Excel sheet for backup and analysis; personal use only (not published)"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a single, personal user, I want the app to automatically extract expenses and incomes from my bank SMS messages so that I can see categorized transactions, add or correct entries manually, track monthly income (including recurring payments), view a dashboard of my current month's spending with charts and trends, and have a daily backup exported to a Google Drive Excel sheet.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the user has received bank SMS messages on their phone, **When** the app scans SMS, **Then** debit and credit transactions are detected and added as tentative transactions with parsed fields (amount, date, merchant/bank text, inferred type).

2. **Given** an extracted tentative transaction with an inferred category, **When** the user reviews it, **Then** they can accept the predicted category or manually change it and the correction updates the transaction and trains/records feedback for future predictions.

3. **Given** the user wants to record income, **When** they add a recurring monthly income (e.g., salary), **Then** the system records it and includes it in monthly totals and trend charts.

4. **Given** a transaction not captured via SMS, **When** the user manually creates an expense, **Then** the transaction is saved with the chosen category and appears in the dashboard and sync.

5. **Given** the end of day, **When** the daily sync runs, **Then** all transactions for that day are appended to a Google Drive Excel file (backup) without duplications and with a summary row for that day.

6. **Given** the user opens the dashboard, **When** it's the current month, **Then** show total expenses, income, category breakdown (pie or bar), daily spending trend (line), and top 5 merchants by spend.

### Edge Cases
- SMS messages with multiple transactions in one message: system should attempt to split and create multiple tentative transactions; if ambiguous, mark for manual review.
- Missed SMS (user deletes or provider blocks access): allow manual entry and an import fallback.
- Duplicate transactions (same amount, date, merchant): use heuristics to detect probable duplicates; require manual confirmation for ambiguous duplicates.
- Connectivity failure during daily sync: retry with exponential backoff; record last successful sync timestamp and show sync status to user.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST scan device SMS inbox for incoming bank/transaction messages and extract candidate transactions (amount, date, raw text, inferred merchant) as tentative records.
- **FR-002**: System MUST parse common bank SMS formats for debit and credit notices and support a way to add parsing rules for additional banks.
- **FR-003**: System MUST predict a category for each tentative transaction and surface the predicted category to the user.
- **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to manually override or correct the category for any transaction; corrections are stored as feedback for improving predictions.
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow users to add recurring income entries (monthly) and treat them as income items in summaries and charts.
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow manual entry of expenses with fields: date, amount, merchant/description, category, notes.
- **FR-007**: System MUST present a dashboard that defaults to the current month showing: total expenses, total income, net balance, category breakdown, daily spending trend, and top merchants.
- **FR-008**: System MUST perform a daily end-of-day export that appends the day's transactions to a Google Drive-hosted Excel file; export must avoid duplicate rows and include a timestamp and summary row.
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow the user to trigger manual sync/export and view last successful sync status and logs.
- **FR-010**: System MUST keep all data private to the user and explicitly note that the app is for personal use only and will not be published to app stores.

*Decisions (resolved)*:
- **FR-002 (parsing rules)**: Default will be a curated set of parsing rules maintained by the app. Additionally, provide an optional, opt-in "Custom parsing rules" area (power-user setting) that lets the single user add or disable simple parsing patterns. Custom rules are stored locally and do not affect other users (fits personal-use scope).
- **FR-008 (Google Drive export)**: Primary backup format will be a single Excel workbook (.xlsx) stored in the user's Google Drive. The daily export appends rows to a single sheet with these columns: transaction_id, date, amount, type (debit/credit), merchant, inferred_category, user_category, source (sms/manual), notes, created_at, updated_at, export_timestamp. CSV export will be supported as an alternative manual/export option. The app requires the user to sign in to their Google account and grant Drive access; the spec records a single backup file reference in user settings.

## Assumptions (best guesses applied)

- The app is strictly single-user (no multi-user sharing or server-side multi-tenant sync). All custom parsing rules and settings are stored locally on the device.
- Daily export runs once per local-device day (user's timezone) shortly after the user's typical bedtime; the app will expose a manual "Run backup now" action.
- Parsing rule updates provided by the app (curated set) will be delivered as app updates or as downloadable rule packs; custom rules are simple pattern-based entries editable by the user in a power-user screen.
- For Drive authentication the user will sign in via OAuth and grant the app access to a single file/folder; the app stores only a reference/id to the backup file in `UserSettings`.
- Deduplication on export uses transaction_id if available, otherwise heuristics on (date, amount, merchant, source) with a configurable tolerance window (e.g., 48 hours).

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Transaction**: date, amount, type (debit/credit), merchant/raw_text, inferred_category, user_category, status (tentative/confirmed), source (sms/manual), created_at, updated_at
- **Income**: date, amount, recurrence (monthly), source, notes
- **UserSettings**: google_drive_backup_enabled, backup_file_id/path, last_sync_at, sms_parsing_preferences, prediction_feedback_enabled
